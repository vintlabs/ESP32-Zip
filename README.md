# ESP32-Zip
## ESP32 Development kit with the same form factor (and similar pinout!) to the Raspberry Pi Zero / Zero Wireless
Note: This is not intended to be used with Pi Hats directly, however it is possible that many will work. If you want to try with a Pi Hat, please check the pinouts very carefully!
